WSL2 LAMP MySQL Fix Commands
================================

The inventory tracker cannot connect to MySQL because the root user needs to be configured.
This is very common in WSL2 LAMP installations.

COPY AND PASTE THESE COMMANDS IN YOUR WSL2 TERMINAL:

1. First, try to access MySQL as root:
   sudo mysql

2. If that works, run these SQL commands (paste one at a time):
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS inventory_tracker;
   EXIT;

3. Test the connection:
   mysql -u root -e "SELECT 'Connection successful!' as status;"

4. If successful, go to: http://localhost/inventory-tracker/install.php

ALTERNATIVE METHOD (if sudo mysql doesn't work):
================================================

Try these commands instead:
1. sudo mysql_secure_installation
   - Follow the prompts
   - Set root password to be empty or "root"

2. Or try resetting with this:
   sudo systemctl stop mysql
   sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
   mysql -u root
   
   Then in MySQL:
   UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('') WHERE User='root';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   EXIT;
   
   sudo systemctl start mysql

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
- Make sure MySQL is running: systemctl status mysql
- Check MySQL error log: sudo tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log
- Restart MySQL: sudo systemctl restart mysql

After fixing MySQL, the inventory tracker will work perfectly!
All the application code is ready - we just need database access.
